Complete the function showHighlight() so that it returns a boolean. Return true if $requestedUrl is the same
as $myUrl. Return true if $requestedUrl is located in the same section as $myUrl, but only if $myUrl is a
landing page. Return true if $myUrl is the landing page of a parent section to $requestedUrl. Assume the
variables $myUrl and $requestedUrl contain valid absolute URL paths as strings. Assume that a root,
section, or subsection landing page always has "index.html" for its filename, and that any other page does
not. A sampling of values and their expected results is listed below.
