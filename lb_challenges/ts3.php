Take the following business requirement and build a small site to support the specific needs. PHP must be
used as some part of the final product. The site can be hosted live on a webserver you have access to, or
you may bundle the files and email them or make them available for download.
A real estate client wants to start collecting visitor information on their site. While very concerned about
being overloaded with spam, they realized it was time for them to start using their site to capture information
and begin to build a list of people that are interested in their properties. They would like the following
information to be collected about a person:
- Name
- Email
- Address
- Phone number
- How they found out about us
- Budget
Once information is collected they would like to be notified and be sent the information about the visitor.
